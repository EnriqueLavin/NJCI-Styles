# Modal plan
## seth
    - Access code is archive420 (I made this up, and it might change)
    -on submit if their code == archive420, modal disappears
    - if it doesn't == archive420, modal remains
    - Once it is styled and approved, this needs to be mass applied to everything in the S3 archive https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/njcannabisinsider.nj.com?prefix=archive%2F&region=us-east-2
        - and each issue that was published on shorthand in the https://njcannabisinsider.nj.com/issues/ folder. Note the lower case i. There are several misleading folders here.
        - the current modal that shows up on the individual issues needs to be removed let me know if you need help with this.
